This is a thinking capability test for the aimux multi-provider system.

Please solve this step-by-step problem:

Problem: Calculate the total cost of ordering 3 pizzas where:
- Pizza 1 costs $12.50 with 20% tax
- Pizza 2 costs $15.75 with 20% tax
- Pizza 3 costs $18.25 with 20% tax
- Delivery fee is $5.00
- Tip is 15% of the subtotal (pizzas + delivery)

Think through this step by step and show all your calculations. This will test whether the thinking capabilities are working correctly through the aimux router.
